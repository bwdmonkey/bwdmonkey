Here are some things about me:
- 🔭 &nbsp;I’m currently working as an assistant manager in my mom's seniorcare business for a bit of fun.
- 🌱 &nbsp;I’m currently/always learning software development, economics, business, and philosophy.
- 📔 &nbsp;Learn a bit more about what I'm thinking through reading some pieces at __[\[bwdmonkey/writings\]](https://github.com/bwdmonkey/writings)__
- 😱 &nbsp;My greatest fear is becoming unable to learn.
- 👀 &nbsp;Ask me about my new set of eyes!
- 📫 &nbsp;The best way to reach me is through email at `tom AT bwdmonkey.dev`
- ⚡ &nbsp;Fun fact: My username comes from my childhood nickname. My Korean name (Lee, Seung Won – 이승원) sounds when read backward sounds quite a bit like monkey in Korean (Won Sung Lee, 원숭이).
